# Visualizing Mode Choice

## Introduction
* The goal of this project was to determine the costs of different modes of transportation to campus, more specifically it was to compare the travel times to UCF based across 10 shuttle routes, 3 modes of transportation (shuttle, bike, driving), and 25 time intervals (7am - 7pm.)

* The approach taken was to gather two kinds of data and combine the values to give an accurate representation of mode times.

**Hard Data**
* Utilizing [Google Maps Distance Matrix APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start) to collect the travel time per route based on **origins**, **destinations, mode, and a [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/get-api-key)**
